# Abstract

This document describes the structure of engine metadata used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0001`](#related).

# Motivation

There are a lot of engines of different types, distributed in different ways and they may require specific runtime environment and complex configuration for execution. This enhancement will unify how engine metadata is described.

# Proposal

## Schema

Each engine must have `meta.json` file with the following properties:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id          | string   | -        | Engine id, case insensitive unique identifier, required only if the engine name is not unique |
| name        | string   | +        | Case sensitive official engine name, may not be unique |
| description | string   | +        | Official engine description, ideally "as is" and two sentences maximum |
| url         | string   | -        | Url to engine homepage (official website, repository or documentation) |
| languages   | string[] | -        | List of supported languages; if not set then assumed that all languages are supported |
| extensions  | string[] | -        | List of filename masks that are processed by the engine, normally it's just extensions; if not set then assumed that all extensions are supported for chosen language(s) |
| configs     | string[] | -        | List of filename masks that could be treated as engine config file, normally it's a filename with extension; if not set then assumed that engine has no config files |
| license     | string   | +        | The license name of the original engine; if the engine has a custom license then it should be equal to `license` and the agreement property set accordingly |
| agreement   | string   | -        | Url or path to the custom license content, if not set then assumed that custom license is located at `license.txt` in the engine folder |

This is the minimal set of properties that allows to identify the engine, understand the target programming language(s), type of analyzed files, detect engine-specific configuration file and find the official website and documentation. Additional properties are allowed, but not required. 

The corresponding schema should be located at [`./schema/meta.json`](#references).

## Example

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://repometric.github.io/linterhub/schema/meta.json",
    "name": "enginename",
    "description": "enginename improves the quality of your life",
    "license": "MIT"
}
```

# Unresolved

- the enum of allowed/supported languages
- the enum of default extensions per language
- the enum of supported licenses
