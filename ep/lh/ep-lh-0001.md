# Abstract

This document introduces [`linterhub`](#references) - the catalog of `engines`. Those engines describe external tools (code analysis tools, code quality checkers, and linters) that check the source code for common mistakes and bad coding style/practices thus helping to catch or prevent errors and forcing to keep a consistent code style. 

# Motivation

The main purpose of the linterhub is to have a central information resource for everything related to engines. linterhub will also unify the way how engines are described. The parts of the enhancement that will be built out first:
- structure of the catalog and data formats
- engine components and schemas

# Proposal

## Structure and formats

The proposal is to have a separate [`linterhub`](#references) repository as a storage for engine related information with the following structure:

```
.
├── engine/
|   ├── enginename1/
|   |   ├── args.json
|   |   ├── deps.json
|   |   └── meta.json
|   └── enginename2/
|       ├── args.json
|       ├── deps.json
|       ├── licence.txt
|       └── meta.json
└── schema/
    ├── args.json
    ├── deps.json
    └── meta.json
```

An overview of what each of these does:

| Path                  | Description |
| -                     | -           |
| `/engine/`            | The root folder for all engines, each engine is isolated in a subfolder |
| `/engine/enginename/` | Folder where all information about engine named `enginename` is stored |
| `/schema/`            | Central place for all schemas and specifications that are used in linterhub |

The `enginename` identifier should be unique and should be equeal to the original tool name.

> NOTE: The lowercase form of this name means `engine id`, while `engine name` is the original tool name.

## Components and schemas

All files that describe the engine (`engine components`) should be in a form of [`JSON`](#references) and/or [`JSON Schema`](#references). Any other data may be stored in engine folder in any format, it is not prohibited.

Each engine must have the following components (detailed explanation in a separate [EPs](#related)):
- [`meta`](#related) - meta-information about original tool: name, license, etc.
- [`args`](#related) - schema of arguments that allows configuring how engine executed
- [`deps`](#related) - the list of runtime dependencies for engine

> Note: Each component has a corresponding JSON schema and it's recommended to explicitly specify it. It may also enable json validation and autocompletion on the fly.

# Unresolved

- engine name conflicts
- engine and schema versioning
