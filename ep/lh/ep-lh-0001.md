# Abstract

This document introduces [`linterhub`](#references) - the catalog of `engines` (code analysis tools, code quality checkers, and linters). Those engines check the source code for common mistakes and bad coding style/practices thus helping to catch or prevent errors and forcing to keep a consistent code style. 

# Motivation

The main purpose of the linterhub is to have a central information resource for everything related to engines. Linterhub will also unify the way how engines are described. The parts of the enhancement that will be built out first:
- structure of the separate repository for engines and data formats;
- engine components and schemas;

# Proposal

## Structure and formats

The proposal is to have a separate [`linterhub`](#references) repository as a storage for engine related information with the following structure:

```
.
├── engine/
|   ├── toolname1/
|   |   ├── args.json
|   |   ├── deps.json
|   |   └── meta.json
|   └── toolname2/
|       ├── args.json
|       ├── deps.json
|       ├── licence.txt
|       └── meta.json
└── schema/
    ├── args.json
    ├── deps.json
    └── meta.json
```

An overview of what each of these does:

| Path        | Description |
| -           | -           |
| `/engine/toolname/`| Isolated folder for all information about the engine (named as the original tool), all mandatory components are mentioned in a components section. |
| `/schema/`  | Central place for all schemas and specifications that are used in linterhub. |

All linterhub files that describe the engine (components) should be in a form of [`JSON`](#references) and corresponding technical specifications in a form of [`JSON Schema`](#references).

## Components and schemas

Each engine must have the following components (detailed explanation including schemas in a separate [EPs](#related)):
- [`meta`](#related) - meta-information about original tool, supported languages, etc.
- [`args`](#related) - schema of execution arguments that allows configuring the engine execution
- [`deps`](#related) - the list of runtime dependencies

Any other data may be stored in engine folder, it is not prohibited.
