# Abstract

This document describes the structure of engine arguments used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0001`](#related).

# Motivation

There are a lot of engines of different types, distributed in different ways and they may require specific runtime environment and complex configuration for execution. This enchantment will unify how engine dependencies are described.

# Proposal

## Schema

Each engine must include `deps.json` file in JSON Schema format with the following properties:

| Property     | Type     | Required | Description |
| -            | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id           | string   | -        | Internal, case insensetive unique identifier, required only if the engine name is not unique |
| name         | string    | +        | Case sensitive official engine name, may not be unique |
| dependencies | object[] | -        | The complex object, which describe several sub-schemas |

This is mostly information that allows identifying engine. As for dependencies property - it describes array of dependencies. Each dependency it is an array itself which allows to specify several ways how engine environment could be prepared (for example on different operational systems).
