# Abstract

This document describes the structure of engine arguments used in linterhub as mentioned in [`ep-lh-0001`](#related).

# Motivation

There are a lot of engines of different types, distributed in different ways and they may require specific runtime environment and complex configuration for execution. This enchantment will unify how engine command line arguments are described.

# Proposal

## Schema

Each engine must have `args.json` file in JSON Schema format with the following properties:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id          | string   | -        | Engine id, case insensitive unique identifier, required only if the engine name is not unique |
| name        | string   | +        | Case sensetive official engine name, may not be unique |
| definitions | object   | +        | The complex object, which describe several sub-schemas |

This is information that allows identifying engine. As for definitions property - it describes arguments itself and configuration section:

### Definitions

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| arguments   | object   | +        | Schema of command line arguments |
| section     | object   | +        | Schema of configuration section for those arguments |
| environment | object   | -        | Schema of some important environment constants |

### Arguments

This is a sub-schema with the following structure:

```json
"arguments": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "The engine command line arguments",
    "properties": {
        "--argument1": {
            "id": "--argument1",
            "type": "number",
            "description": "This is used for something",
            "default": 0
        },
        "argument2": {
            "id": "prefix:argument2",
            "type": "null",
            "description": "This is used for anything"
        }
    }
```

Each named command line argument is defined as a named property (original argument name is used for that) and it is a JSON Schema object with the following properties:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| id          | string   | -        | The name of the argument from the original tool, may have prefix depending on the purpose; if not set then assumed that argument is not used |
| type        | string   | +        | The value type of the argument |
| description | string   | +        | Help text from the original tool for that argument, two sentences maximum |
| default     | any      | -        | The default value for that argument; if argument is readonly and default is not set then 0, "" or null is used |

A prefix in argument id is used internally to identify the argument purpose:

| Prefix      | Meaning  | 
| -           | :-:      |
| ""          | There is no prefix, readonly argument and it's value could not be changed |
| "arg"       | Influence the analysis and it's allowed to change the value |
| "linterhub" | Reserved argument and it's value could not be changed, it's computed on the fly  |

### Section

This is an object, which is introduced due to some limitations in JSON Schemas. It describes how engine configuration could be stored and normally only engine name should be changed in this template:

```json
"section": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "The engine configuration section",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The engine name",
            "enum": [
                "engine name"
            ]
        },
        "options": {
            "type": "object",
            "description": "The engine configuration",
            "$ref": "#/definitions/options"
        }
    }
}
```

> Note: It allows to have an array of configurations for different engines and explicitly determine which engine has the corresponding schema.

### Environment

 This is a JSON Schema object, which store the following information:

| Property    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| executable  | string   | -        | The engine executable name, the name that used in the OS may dffer from the official name; if not set then assumend that it's equal to engine name |
| masks       | boolean  | -        | Whether filename masks are supported by engine, default is true |
| success     | number   | -        | Success exit code, if not set then it's assumed equal to 0 |
| version     | boolean  | -        | The engine version, equal to the output of version command, it may be used for debuggig purposes; by default it's assumed that engine doesn't support that feature |

## Example

Here is the full example for engine 'enginename':

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://repometric.github.io/linterhub/schema/args.json",
    "id": "enginename",
    "type": "object",
    "allOf": [
        {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/options"
        }
    ],
    "definitions": {
        "environment": {
            "executable": "enginename.sh",
            "success": 1
        },
        "options": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "--configurable": {
                    "id": "args:--configurable",
                    "type": "null",
                    "description": "configurable argument"
                },
                "--readonly": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "not configurable argument",
                    "default": "string value"
                },
                "--version": {
                    "id": "linterhub:version",
                    "type": "null",
                    "description": "reserved argument"
                },
                "": {
                    "id": "linterhub:path",
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "reserved unnamed argument"
                }
            }
        },
        "section": {
            "type": "object",
            "description": "The engine configuration section",
            "properties": {
                "name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The engine name",
                    "enum": [
                        "enginename"
                    ]
                },
                "options": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "description": "The engine configuration",
                    "$ref": "#/definitions/options"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Unresolved

- the structure of section object is complicated and unclear
- the argument types are not described
- positional arguments are not described
- path argument and argument without a name are not described
- linterhub internal arguments are not defined
- configuration via files is not described
- unclear situation with filename masks
